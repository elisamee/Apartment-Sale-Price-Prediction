# Daegu Apartment Sale Price Prediction

## Context
---

Daegu, South Korea's fourth-largest metropolitan city, boasts a population exceeding 2.3 million. Once an economic powerhouse during the 1960s-1980s, Daegu is particularly renowned for its manufacture and textile industries. This economic strength continues to attract foreign professionals seeking career opportunities. In addition to its economic allure, Daegu offers prestigious universities and a lower cost of living compared to Seoul, along with a desirable balance of urban amenities and natural attractions. These factors are increasingly leading people, both local and foreign, to consider Daegu as a place to live, driving up demand for housing, particularly apartments, the most popular housing type in South Korea. High demand also raises the possibility of illogical sale prices being set by some sellers.

Predicting apartment sale prices in Daegu's dynamic real estate market is crucial for the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) to effectively regulate the market and prevent unfair practices. However, traditional methods of price analysis can be time-consuming and subjective, relying on manual data analysis and expert opinions.  

This project aims to develop a predictive machine learning model that assists the KFTC in monitoring Daegu's apartment sale market prices. The model will be built upon relevant features and used to inform potential regulations for apartment sale prices in the city.
